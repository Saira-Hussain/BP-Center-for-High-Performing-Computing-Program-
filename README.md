# BP-Center-for-High-Performing-Computing-Program-
In this apprenticeship, with experienced mentors from BP CHPC, my team worked to solve real-world  problems and code a solution using Python. Here, we enhanced our python skills, explored  machine learning, and discovered what a career at HPC or CHPC is like.

We were given three problems to solve. 

Problem 1: 
Given the dimensions of the surveyed area and the distance between each node, calculate the number of nodes the OBN needs to place and graph the solution

Problem 2: 
Given a csv file with tapes, organize the tape data amounts from least to greatest and export it as a csv file

Problem 3:
On a good day, the OBN boat goes 21 knots (about 24 mph), and on a bad day, the boat goes 17 knots (about 19.5 mph). Each day the boat runs costs $1 million and it takes 30 minutes to place each node. Given a csv files with good and bad day predictions, determine the cost and total days the operation will take.
